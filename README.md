## Website description

  This is an online flower shop that helps the user to find the best flowers to gift by asking him/her
  the price he/she wants to spend, the main color of the bouquet, and also the kind of event and who will
  go to receive the gift. Once the user finds the product that fits the selected criteria, is asked for
  the final order details, like the number of flowers, the type of delivery, to finally place the order.

  This page shows a beautiful bouquet and describes the type of work they offer to their customers. The big
  button at the left lets the user start the buying process or, if preferred, he/she can scroll down to find product samples, 
  testimonials from other customers, or the map with the physical location of the store.

  Once in this place, the user can select the products that best match his/her preferences by choosing the 
  desired options in the filter on the left side. This action results in a grid of pictures on the right side
  to let the user choose between his/her favorite products.
